  <p>I have an interest over a range of topics, from Frontend, Backend, to DevOps. As such, I attend a wide array of meetups events, sometimes I participate in them too :P</p>
  <p>Currently speaking on the following topics: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Serverless and CI in Google Cloud Platform</li>
    <li>Trigonometry in Sass, and engineering principles with CSS</li>
    <li>Soompi's migration from Wordpress to services and microservices</li>
  </ul>
