  <p>I&apos;m currently working as a Full Stack Engineer in Rakuten Viki. On the side, I also serve a co-supervisor role with a project called Archipelago, a classroom web tool hosted by the National University of Singapore</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I&apos;ve recently embarked on a new interest in public speaking and writing. I am usually blogging on Medium, and the talks I&apos;ve done can be found in the Engineers.sg profile linked above.</p>
