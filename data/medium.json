It was great meeting all of you last week, in the online event organised by <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/developer-space/\">Google Developers Space</a>.</p>\n<p>There were several questions asked during the livestream, that we were not able to answer due to the time constraints. As such, we would like to answer those questions that we could not get to answer during this event in this blogpost.</p>\n<p>Before jumping into the Q&amp;A, let\u2019s recap on the actual livestream itself:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/b2a22d39ffb5a32e7c3e1ad85ff4798b/href\">https://medium.com/media/b2a22d39ffb5a32e7c3e1ad85ff4798b/href</a><h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<p><strong>Q1: </strong>I have an App Engine\u200a\u2014\u200aNodejs application that uses the Firebase Auth library for authentication. To secure my Firebase API key, I store it in Secrets Manager and retrieve it as I start the app. What do you think of this approach?</p>\n<p><strong>Harizuan</strong></p>\n<p>This approach does sound pretty decent. This approach is already way better approach as compared to past approaches (e.g. embedded the encrypted version of the secret within application code\u00a0base)</p>\n<p>For people unfamiliar with secrets manager, you might want to check the following content:</p>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njLFmehO_OY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njLFmehO_OY</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/secrets-and-serverless-managing-and-deploying-secrets-with-kms-and-secret-manager-in-google-cloud-8ec3bad0f800\">https://levelup.gitconnected.com/secrets-and-serverless-managing-and-deploying-secrets-with-kms-and-secret-manager-in-google-cloud-8ec3bad0f800</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1wtjEmb7eI&amp;t=115s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1wtjEmb7eI&amp;t=115s</a></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>Secret Manager is awesome! I really love the fact that versioning for secrets and integrating with modern-day applications is seamless when using this\u00a0tool.</p>\n<p>Check out the following library for interacting with Secrets Manager in Nodejs, <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-secret-manager\">https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-secret-manager</a>. Using this library, you can also opt to retrieve your secrets when you need it or update it with a cron job. This will allow you to rotate secrets easily, without the need to restart your application.</p>\n<p><strong>Q2: </strong>What would be the best learning path to learn serverless with GCP, if I am completely new to writings apps to run in the\u00a0cloud?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>If you need Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to try out\u200a\u2014\u200ayou could try and see if you can get <a href=\"https://google.qwiklabs.com/\">Qwiklab</a> credits from upcoming events? We\u2019ll continue advertising such events in the future once we hear about\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Either that, or you could go for cloud functions where if you use languages like Python, Nodejs. This would allow you to focus on specific on application development.</p>\n<p>Building applications on the serverless options on GCP usually tend to be on the cheaper side of things. Cloud Functions and Cloud Run have a pretty generous free tier which can use; if you\u2019re not exactly having production level traffics, it is pretty hard to use it all up. Personally, I\u2019ve been using Cloud Functions for some of my little side projects on the side and the bill amounts to under 5 cents per month. The function generally runs for like a minute per day at most; the bill is mostly for storing data in GCS, Google Cloud datastore</p>\n<p>Generally, I would recommend cloud run at this stage but that would require Docker as pre-requisite knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>Use Qwiklabs! \u2192 <a href=\"https://google.qwiklabs.com/\">https://google.qwiklabs.com/</a>\u00a0. It's an awesome platform for learning all about Google Cloud Platform, not just serverless. Time to time, meetup groups, Qwiklabs (the provider), and Google will release codes that you can use to use Qwiklabs for\u00a0free.</p>\n<p>Check out the following quests in Qwiklabs for Serverless concepts in\u00a0GCP:</p>\n<blockquote>Cloud Run: <a href=\"https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/98\">https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/98</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Deploying App Engine and Cloud Functions: <a href=\"https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/26\">https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/26</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Previously, as a student, I also benefited a lot from using GCP\u2019s free tier for learning and experimentation. The smallest configuration on App Engine is available for no cost, up to 28 instance hours a day (essentially free!). Cloud Run and Cloud Functions also have high free quota per day, making it really attractive. See here for more details: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free\">https://cloud.google.com/free</a></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*HDKhUQz-F2CrjcKY\"><figcaption>Google Cloud Platform free tier offerings, source\u200a\u2014\u200a<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free\">Google</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Q3: </strong>Not sure if cloud function now supporting Java?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Cloud Function has supported Java for quite some time. Recently, Java 11 is also being supported; see the announcement here: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-java-11-on-google-cloud-functions\">https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-java-11-on-google-cloud-functions</a></p>\n<p><strong>Q4: </strong>With monoliths, you have one thing to take care of. With microservices, you may have hundreds of things to manage, with cloud functions you may have many thousands. How would you manage such a\u00a0beast?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>Handling all those code and deployments just mean that one/the company involved need to automate as much as possible. Each service going to production should ideally go through the deployment process (e.g. deployment review, load etc). The more of development that you can automate out and move away\u200a\u2014\u200athe easier it would be in order to attempt to control such a situation (and yes, it\u2019s also important to look at the pitfalls of such approaches)</p>\n<p>You can automate it to the point where on a new service being made available\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can have scripts to create the required resources on the GCP project. E.g. Cloud Pubsub publishers and subscribers? GCS\u00a0Buckets?</p>\n<p>It comes with other nice benefits of being repeatable (if done well)\u200a\u2014\u200ain the case where you lost access to the project etc, you can repeat this to a new GCS\u00a0project)</p>\n<p>And with more automation needed\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will need to ensure your CI/CD deployment pipelines can take it. Some people just assume one can use Jenkins to do this work, but they forgot to realize that using another workload to manage your workloads would mean now, you have to make sure you can scale it in order to manage it. Plenty of effort is needed to make sure that this doesn\u2019t go down\u200a\u2014\u200aso that is another thing you need to consider. My personal opinion is that if you can afford to use a managed build system\u200a\u2014\u200ause it. The amount of effort it takes to make sure the build system stays up is quite expensive (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS-MAVMjfQI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS-MAVMjfQI</a>)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the same with logging and monitoring systems; if you can afford to utilize managed services, use it. These systems are extremely critical to understand applications. If such systems ever go down, you can surely guess that it\u2019s gonna be an extremely painful\u00a0affair.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you managed to do all this and you\u2019re deploying applications at very high rates. You can lead to an issue where a new application update can break a whole chunk of the functionality of the product. Now, it boils down to good computing practices to make sure developers are not delivering things that would results in issues in the downstream application. In the microservice world\u200a\u2014\u200aapplications become dependent on one another\u200a\u2014\u200ait becomes extremely important to be the gracious neighbour\u200a\u2014\u200amake sure you\u2019re not the dude that keep changing api changes, forcing downstream applications to change it with you (this is a tiring game to play\u200a\u2014\u200alike a never-ending process of cat and\u00a0mouse)</p>\n<p>One way in order to attempt to avoid this would be to do up API contracts between components: <a href=\"https://microservices.io/patterns/testing/service-integration-contract-test.html\">https://microservices.io/patterns/testing/service-integration-contract-test.html</a></p>\n<p>The services should be tested to make sure that it doesn\u2019t break on the API\u00a0layer.</p>\n<p>TLDR version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automate as much as\u00a0possible</li>\n<li>Use managed services as much as\u00a0possible</li>\n<li>Build system\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle Cloud\u00a0Build</li>\n<li>Artifact Delivery\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle Cloud Registry, Google Cloud\u00a0Storage</li>\n<li>Logging/Monitoring\u200a\u2014\u200aStackdriver</li>\n<li>Automated resource management (Ansible, Terraform, Chef)</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t break interfaces with other applications (Be gracious)</li>\n<li>Try to have a common way to do retries and ensure applications have proper degraded ways to respond to requests. Bad retry policies can lead to thundering herd situation (a retry that keeps retrying forever result in the number of requests to increase infinitely within the\u00a0system)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>I would put it this way\u200a\u2014\u200awhile maintaining 1000 unique microservices sounds like a daunting task,<strong> having to debug a single error in a monolith that is the combination of these 1000 microservices is no simple task as\u00a0well</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s simulate an error occurring across both of these configurations. We will assume that the basic telemetry of metrics and logs, and alerting, are integrated for both configurations.</p>\n<p>For the monolith, there might be lesser metrics and logs to observe, in addition to them being categorized together for different functionalities. This can make debugging or fixing a bug much harder than a microservice. For a microservice, if an alert is triggered, it is very easy to pinpoint factors leading to the error in metrics and logs that reflects its own\u00a0status.</p>\n<p><strong>The crucial part is the initial setup\u200a\u2014\u200aevery new microservice should be integrated with the proper tools\u200a\u2014\u200afor metrics dashboard, alerting, and logs. If not, it will be hard to manage each service individually.</strong></p>\n<p>Automation is also important when you reach the scale of 100s and 1000s of services, to keep things manageable. Look into self-healing for microservices which can explain more on\u00a0this.</p>\n<p>That said, my personal opinion is that you should look into if you have enough manpower to support microservices throughout. Microservices is just one of the solutions out there, like a monolith and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). There is no solution that is more \u201ccorrect\u201d than the other, only the solution that is the most suitable for a team or organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: </strong>So is it fair to say\u200a\u2014\u200aone doesn\u2019t need to use Google AppEngine anymore?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>Yes and No. If you have already been used to app engine, e.g. your app in build upon app engine, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to rewrite such apps yet to utilize other serverless tools (e.g. cloud run). As of now, it seems unlikely that Google would stop supporting AppEngine\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if they do, it\u2019ll take a while before any such features are ever depreciated. In one of my previous roles, I got to see the whole depreciation process\u200a\u2014\u200ait takes a really long time for the depreciation of critical features. Initially, GCP would blast users of the feature with continuous notifications warning about depreciation. The depreciation would start appearing in the logs. Eventually, they start announcements of reduced availability of the service (which would then kind of force people to move away\u200a\u2014\u200anotifications are not that strong of a factor). A reduced availability from 99.9% to 90% is apparently very very obvious\u200a\u2014\u200aany engineer seeing the sudden spike in latencies/failed requests would freak out and begin to refactor/rework his application accordingly.</p>\n<p>It would be said that AppEngine is just another choice in the GCP world. There are still features in Appengine that appeal to some groups of appeal (e.g. centralized dashboard that holds meta information of the application.) Control of application deployments via a central YAML file etc. Ease of deployment. Lack of need to deal with docker (for some, docker is actually a turn-off -&gt; I can\u2019t explain this point seeing that I kind of grew up with Docker in my computing career)</p>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>In some sense, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/custom-runtimes/build\">App Engine Flex\u200a\u2014\u200aCustom Runtime</a> can be directly replaced by Cloud Run. Both tools support a Dockerfile as the base configuration for the application.</p>\n<p>When comparing the two tools, we can immediately see one obvious difference: Cloud Run\u2019s instances are based on gVisor, a container sandbox runtime, and built with Knative, while App Engine Flexible\u2019s instances started as Compute Engine\u2019s VMs. <strong>This translates into Cloud Run generally being able to deploy and scale faster than the App Engine Flex counterpart.</strong> See here for a side by side comparison: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j6da-Kq8TYU\">https://youtu.be/j6da-Kq8TYU</a></p>\n<p>However, the above only applies to App Engine Flex\u200a\u2014\u200aCustom Runtime. <strong>If you\u2019re simply looking to deploy an application (e.g. a Nodejs application) and not be concerned with maintaining dependencies in a Dockerfile, </strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/runtimes\"><strong>App Engine Standard</strong></a><strong> is going to be your\u00a0answer.</strong></p>\n<p>Another benefit for App Engine is the numerous use cases and support in GCP built up over the years. For example, being able to interface with a managed Redis store with MemoryStore. That said, Cloud Run is looking at <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-vpc\">catching\u00a0up</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: </strong>Does it make sense to go with microservices in a non-Cloud world? The orchestration, monitoring, testing, etc might be much tougher if it is not in Cloud environment? Or are there ways around\u00a0it?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>It kind of boils down to\u00a0company</p>\n<p>Actually, I would worry if you\u2019re not doing monitoring and testing -&gt; these are needed even if you\u2019re on the \u201cmonolith\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ajust that testing it is slightly\u00a0harder.</p>\n<p>Monitoring is not a \u201cmicroservice\u201d thing\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s needed for you to kind of reason about production workloads. On the cloud, certain metrics may pose less importances as some of it becomes the cloud vendor\u2019s responsibility to take care of it. Most of the time, you can kind of assume that \u201cthings just work\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. IO throughput to your hardware devices, network throughput\u200a\u2014\u200athe cloud vendors have pretty stable infrastructure to guarantee certain numbers. Unfortunately, in the non-cloud world\u200a\u2014\u200athese numbers are extremely critical to the ones that maintain the infrastructure/applications. You can have your \u201cnoisy neighbour\u201d effect being way more pronounced\u200a\u2014\u200aand this noisy neighbour can easily impact the whole \u201cdatacentre\u201d worth of infrastructure and applications.</p>\n<p>Testing is kind of a minimum of minimum\u200a\u2014\u200ait provides a level of safety of developers. This would probably a wrong place to debate on whether testing is necessary for applications but instead, I\u2019ll refer you to watch the following video\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough its from a Golang talk, it can be applied broadly to the development process. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6oP24CSdUg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6oP24CSdUg</a></p>\n<p>Before going deeper into orchestration, it might be good to look into the definition of it\u200a\u2014\u200a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)</a>\u200a\u2014\u200aso, if you\u2019re not orchestrating your systems, that would mean that you\u2019re doing things manually\u200a\u2014\u200anaturally, microservices would be a really hard game to handle. For each application that is to deployed to production, it should ideally go through all development pipeline processes. If you have 2 or even more, and each of them requiring to go through the pipeline -&gt; you can imagine the pain and stress the people managing the applications/deployment would go through, it would want to make one stop all deployments. Which would naturally reduce frequency of release of services.

It was great meeting all of you last week, in the online event organised by <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/developer-space/\">Google Developers Space</a>.</p>\n<p>There were several questions asked during the livestream, that we were not able to answer due to the time constraints. As such, we would like to answer those questions that we could not get to answer during this event in this blogpost.</p>\n<p>Before jumping into the Q&amp;A, let\u2019s recap on the actual livestream itself:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/b2a22d39ffb5a32e7c3e1ad85ff4798b/href\">https://medium.com/media/b2a22d39ffb5a32e7c3e1ad85ff4798b/href</a><h3>Q&amp;A</h3>\n<p><strong>Q1: </strong>I have an App Engine\u200a\u2014\u200aNodejs application that uses the Firebase Auth library for authentication. To secure my Firebase API key, I store it in Secrets Manager and retrieve it as I start the app. What do you think of this approach?</p>\n<p><strong>Harizuan</strong></p>\n<p>This approach does sound pretty decent. This approach is already way better approach as compared to past approaches (e.g. embedded the encrypted version of the secret within application code\u00a0base)</p>\n<p>For people unfamiliar with secrets manager, you might want to check the following content:</p>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njLFmehO_OY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njLFmehO_OY</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/secrets-and-serverless-managing-and-deploying-secrets-with-kms-and-secret-manager-in-google-cloud-8ec3bad0f800\">https://levelup.gitconnected.com/secrets-and-serverless-managing-and-deploying-secrets-with-kms-and-secret-manager-in-google-cloud-8ec3bad0f800</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1wtjEmb7eI&amp;t=115s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1wtjEmb7eI&amp;t=115s</a></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>Secret Manager is awesome! I really love the fact that versioning for secrets and integrating with modern-day applications is seamless when using this\u00a0tool.</p>\n<p>Check out the following library for interacting with Secrets Manager in Nodejs, <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-secret-manager\">https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-secret-manager</a>. Using this library, you can also opt to retrieve your secrets when you need it or update it with a cron job. This will allow you to rotate secrets easily, without the need to restart your application.</p>\n<p><strong>Q2: </strong>What would be the best learning path to learn serverless with GCP, if I am completely new to writings apps to run in the\u00a0cloud?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>If you need Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to try out\u200a\u2014\u200ayou could try and see if you can get <a href=\"https://google.qwiklabs.com/\">Qwiklab</a> credits from upcoming events? We\u2019ll continue advertising such events in the future once we hear about\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Either that, or you could go for cloud functions where if you use languages like Python, Nodejs. This would allow you to focus on specific on application development.</p>\n<p>Building applications on the serverless options on GCP usually tend to be on the cheaper side of things. Cloud Functions and Cloud Run have a pretty generous free tier which can use; if you\u2019re not exactly having production level traffics, it is pretty hard to use it all up. Personally, I\u2019ve been using Cloud Functions for some of my little side projects on the side and the bill amounts to under 5 cents per month. The function generally runs for like a minute per day at most; the bill is mostly for storing data in GCS, Google Cloud datastore</p>\n<p>Generally, I would recommend cloud run at this stage but that would require Docker as pre-requisite knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>Use Qwiklabs! \u2192 <a href=\"https://google.qwiklabs.com/\">https://google.qwiklabs.com/</a>\u00a0. It's an awesome platform for learning all about Google Cloud Platform, not just serverless. Time to time, meetup groups, Qwiklabs (the provider), and Google will release codes that you can use to use Qwiklabs for\u00a0free.</p>\n<p>Check out the following quests in Qwiklabs for Serverless concepts in\u00a0GCP:</p>\n<blockquote>Cloud Run: <a href=\"https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/98\">https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/98</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Deploying App Engine and Cloud Functions: <a href=\"https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/26\">https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/26</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Previously, as a student, I also benefited a lot from using GCP\u2019s free tier for learning and experimentation. The smallest configuration on App Engine is available for no cost, up to 28 instance hours a day (essentially free!). Cloud Run and Cloud Functions also have high free quota per day, making it really attractive. See here for more details: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free\">https://cloud.google.com/free</a></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*HDKhUQz-F2CrjcKY\"><figcaption>Google Cloud Platform free tier offerings, source\u200a\u2014\u200a<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free\">Google</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Q3: </strong>Not sure if cloud function now supporting Java?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Cloud Function has supported Java for quite some time. Recently, Java 11 is also being supported; see the announcement here: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-java-11-on-google-cloud-functions\">https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-java-11-on-google-cloud-functions</a></p>\n<p><strong>Q4: </strong>With monoliths, you have one thing to take care of. With microservices, you may have hundreds of things to manage, with cloud functions you may have many thousands. How would you manage such a\u00a0beast?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>Handling all those code and deployments just mean that one/the company involved need to automate as much as possible. Each service going to production should ideally go through the deployment process (e.g. deployment review, load etc). The more of development that you can automate out and move away\u200a\u2014\u200athe easier it would be in order to attempt to control such a situation (and yes, it\u2019s also important to look at the pitfalls of such approaches)</p>\n<p>You can automate it to the point where on a new service being made available\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can have scripts to create the required resources on the GCP project. E.g. Cloud Pubsub publishers and subscribers? GCS\u00a0Buckets?</p>\n<p>It comes with other nice benefits of being repeatable (if done well)\u200a\u2014\u200ain the case where you lost access to the project etc, you can repeat this to a new GCS\u00a0project)</p>\n<p>And with more automation needed\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will need to ensure your CI/CD deployment pipelines can take it. Some people just assume one can use Jenkins to do this work, but they forgot to realize that using another workload to manage your workloads would mean now, you have to make sure you can scale it in order to manage it. Plenty of effort is needed to make sure that this doesn\u2019t go down\u200a\u2014\u200aso that is another thing you need to consider. My personal opinion is that if you can afford to use a managed build system\u200a\u2014\u200ause it. The amount of effort it takes to make sure the build system stays up is quite expensive (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS-MAVMjfQI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS-MAVMjfQI</a>)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the same with logging and monitoring systems; if you can afford to utilize managed services, use it. These systems are extremely critical to understand applications. If such systems ever go down, you can surely guess that it\u2019s gonna be an extremely painful\u00a0affair.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you managed to do all this and you\u2019re deploying applications at very high rates. You can lead to an issue where a new application update can break a whole chunk of the functionality of the product. Now, it boils down to good computing practices to make sure developers are not delivering things that would results in issues in the downstream application. In the microservice world\u200a\u2014\u200aapplications become dependent on one another\u200a\u2014\u200ait becomes extremely important to be the gracious neighbour\u200a\u2014\u200amake sure you\u2019re not the dude that keep changing api changes, forcing downstream applications to change it with you (this is a tiring game to play\u200a\u2014\u200alike a never-ending process of cat and\u00a0mouse)</p>\n<p>One way in order to attempt to avoid this would be to do up API contracts between components: <a href=\"https://microservices.io/patterns/testing/service-integration-contract-test.html\">https://microservices.io/patterns/testing/service-integration-contract-test.html</a></p>\n<p>The services should be tested to make sure that it doesn\u2019t break on the API\u00a0layer.</p>\n<p>TLDR version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automate as much as\u00a0possible</li>\n<li>Use managed services as much as\u00a0possible</li>\n<li>Build system\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle Cloud\u00a0Build</li>\n<li>Artifact Delivery\u200a\u2014\u200aGoogle Cloud Registry, Google Cloud\u00a0Storage</li>\n<li>Logging/Monitoring\u200a\u2014\u200aStackdriver</li>\n<li>Automated resource management (Ansible, Terraform, Chef)</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t break interfaces with other applications (Be gracious)</li>\n<li>Try to have a common way to do retries and ensure applications have proper degraded ways to respond to requests. Bad retry policies can lead to thundering herd situation (a retry that keeps retrying forever result in the number of requests to increase infinitely within the\u00a0system)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>I would put it this way\u200a\u2014\u200awhile maintaining 1000 unique microservices sounds like a daunting task,<strong> having to debug a single error in a monolith that is the combination of these 1000 microservices is no simple task as\u00a0well</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s simulate an error occurring across both of these configurations. We will assume that the basic telemetry of metrics and logs, and alerting, are integrated for both configurations.</p>\n<p>For the monolith, there might be lesser metrics and logs to observe, in addition to them being categorized together for different functionalities. This can make debugging or fixing a bug much harder than a microservice. For a microservice, if an alert is triggered, it is very easy to pinpoint factors leading to the error in metrics and logs that reflects its own\u00a0status.</p>\n<p><strong>The crucial part is the initial setup\u200a\u2014\u200aevery new microservice should be integrated with the proper tools\u200a\u2014\u200afor metrics dashboard, alerting, and logs. If not, it will be hard to manage each service individually.</strong></p>\n<p>Automation is also important when you reach the scale of 100s and 1000s of services, to keep things manageable. Look into self-healing for microservices which can explain more on\u00a0this.</p>\n<p>That said, my personal opinion is that you should look into if you have enough manpower to support microservices throughout. Microservices is just one of the solutions out there, like a monolith and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). There is no solution that is more \u201ccorrect\u201d than the other, only the solution that is the most suitable for a team or organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: </strong>So is it fair to say\u200a\u2014\u200aone doesn\u2019t need to use Google AppEngine anymore?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>Yes and No. If you have already been used to app engine, e.g. your app in build upon app engine, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to rewrite such apps yet to utilize other serverless tools (e.g. cloud run). As of now, it seems unlikely that Google would stop supporting AppEngine\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if they do, it\u2019ll take a while before any such features are ever depreciated. In one of my previous roles, I got to see the whole depreciation process\u200a\u2014\u200ait takes a really long time for the depreciation of critical features. Initially, GCP would blast users of the feature with continuous notifications warning about depreciation. The depreciation would start appearing in the logs. Eventually, they start announcements of reduced availability of the service (which would then kind of force people to move away\u200a\u2014\u200anotifications are not that strong of a factor). A reduced availability from 99.9% to 90% is apparently very very obvious\u200a\u2014\u200aany engineer seeing the sudden spike in latencies/failed requests would freak out and begin to refactor/rework his application accordingly.</p>\n<p>It would be said that AppEngine is just another choice in the GCP world. There are still features in Appengine that appeal to some groups of appeal (e.g. centralized dashboard that holds meta information of the application.) Control of application deployments via a central YAML file etc. Ease of deployment. Lack of need to deal with docker (for some, docker is actually a turn-off -&gt; I can\u2019t explain this point seeing that I kind of grew up with Docker in my computing career)</p>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>In some sense, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/custom-runtimes/build\">App Engine Flex\u200a\u2014\u200aCustom Runtime</a> can be directly replaced by Cloud Run. Both tools support a Dockerfile as the base configuration for the application.</p>\n<p>When comparing the two tools, we can immediately see one obvious difference: Cloud Run\u2019s instances are based on gVisor, a container sandbox runtime, and built with Knative, while App Engine Flexible\u2019s instances started as Compute Engine\u2019s VMs. <strong>This translates into Cloud Run generally being able to deploy and scale faster than the App Engine Flex counterpart.</strong> See here for a side by side comparison: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j6da-Kq8TYU\">https://youtu.be/j6da-Kq8TYU</a></p>\n<p>However, the above only applies to App Engine Flex\u200a\u2014\u200aCustom Runtime. <strong>If you\u2019re simply looking to deploy an application (e.g. a Nodejs application) and not be concerned with maintaining dependencies in a Dockerfile, </strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/runtimes\"><strong>App Engine Standard</strong></a><strong> is going to be your\u00a0answer.</strong></p>\n<p>Another benefit for App Engine is the numerous use cases and support in GCP built up over the years. For example, being able to interface with a managed Redis store with MemoryStore. That said, Cloud Run is looking at <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-vpc\">catching\u00a0up</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: </strong>Does it make sense to go with microservices in a non-Cloud world? The orchestration, monitoring, testing, etc might be much tougher if it is not in Cloud environment? Or are there ways around\u00a0it?</p>\n<p><strong>Hairizuan</strong></p>\n<p>It kind of boils down to\u00a0company</p>\n<p>Actually, I would worry if you\u2019re not doing monitoring and testing -&gt; these are needed even if you\u2019re on the \u201cmonolith\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ajust that testing it is slightly\u00a0harder.</p>\n<p>Monitoring is not a \u201cmicroservice\u201d thing\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s needed for you to kind of reason about production workloads. On the cloud, certain metrics may pose less importances as some of it becomes the cloud vendor\u2019s responsibility to take care of it. Most of the time, you can kind of assume that \u201cthings just work\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. IO throughput to your hardware devices, network throughput\u200a\u2014\u200athe cloud vendors have pretty stable infrastructure to guarantee certain numbers. Unfortunately, in the non-cloud world\u200a\u2014\u200athese numbers are extremely critical to the ones that maintain the infrastructure/applications. You can have your \u201cnoisy neighbour\u201d effect being way more pronounced\u200a\u2014\u200aand this noisy neighbour can easily impact the whole \u201cdatacentre\u201d worth of infrastructure and applications.</p>\n<p>Testing is kind of a minimum of minimum\u200a\u2014\u200ait provides a level of safety of developers. This would probably a wrong place to debate on whether testing is necessary for applications but instead, I\u2019ll refer you to watch the following video\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough its from a Golang talk, it can be applied broadly to the development process. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6oP24CSdUg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6oP24CSdUg</a></p>\n<p>Before going deeper into orchestration, it might be good to look into the definition of it\u200a\u2014\u200a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)</a>\u200a\u2014\u200aso, if you\u2019re not orchestrating your systems, that would mean that you\u2019re doing things manually\u200a\u2014\u200anaturally, microservices would be a really hard game to handle. For each application that is to deployed to production, it should ideally go through all development pipeline processes. If you have 2 or even more, and each of them requiring to go through the pipeline -&gt; you can imagine the pain and stress the people managing the applications/deployment would go through, it would want to make one stop all deployments. Which would naturally reduce frequency of release of services. And this leads to a completely different outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Weiyuan</strong></p>\n<p>Each organization has its own requirements and needs. A one-man developer in a startup may resort to building the product as a monolith for ease of development and maintenance, while a larger organization can turn to services or microservices where the level of granularity is properly matched with the different teams.

If an application is rewritten from one to the other, that\u2019s more on the application code, where DevOps expertise is not directly required.</p>\n<p>However, the crucial part of any service architecture, in terms of DevOps, is figuring out the pieces of the puzzle to solve\u200a\u2014\u200aservice deployment, telemetry, and proper maintenance guidelines (e.g. documentation, playbooks and auto-healing for dealing with system failures)</p>\n<p>On the end of my \u201cDevOps journey\u201d, it is a continuous learning journey for me. I would recommend Qwiklabs very heavily, as it provides a sandbox environment for hands-on learning, unlike just reading plainly from the documentation.</p>\n<p>We have provided out answers as per the questions above.
